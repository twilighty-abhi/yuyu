## Stack

- Next.js 16 App Router and React 19
- TypeScript
- PostgreSQL and Prisma ORM
- Auth.js with Prisma persistence
- Material UI and Emotion
- Redis for distributed rate limiting
- S3-compatible private object storage
- Nodemailer-backed transactional email
- Vitest and Playwright

## Repository layout

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `app/` | Pages, layouts, Server Actions, and route handlers |
| `components/` | Client and server UI components grouped by product area |
| `lib/` | Authentication, authorization, validation, RSVP logic, storage, email, rate limiting, and shared services |
| `prisma/` | Data model and ordered production migrations |
| `scripts/` | Environment, schema, asset migration, and standalone-build helpers |
| `tests/` | Unit, PostgreSQL integration, and browser suites |
| `docs/` | Product and operational documentation |

```

Server Actions are used for authenticated dashboard mutations. Public RSVP and feedback submissions use JSON route handlers. Authorization belongs on the server even when the UI hides an unavailable control.

## Multi-tenancy and authorization

`Organisation` is the tenant boundary. Events, series, invitations, assets, and audit events resolve through an organisation. `Membership` connects a user to a tenant with an owner, admin, or member role. Permission helpers and action-specific checks enforce access before mutation.

The super-admin boundary is separate: access requires an authenticated email matching `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL`, and unauthorized requests behave as not found.

## Main data areas

- Identity: `User`, `Account`, `Session`, and `VerificationToken`.
- Tenancy: `Organisation`, `Membership`, and `OrganisationInvite`.
- Events: `Event`, `EventInvite`, `EventSeries`, `SeriesInvite`, and `EventInstance`.
- Registration: `RSVP`, registration forms, fields, and typed answers.
- Feedback: feedback forms, fields, responses, typed answers, and optional certificate linkage.
- Operations: `OutboxMessage`, `AuditEvent`, `CheckInEvent`, `RsvpDeletionUndo`, and `Asset`.

Refer to `prisma/schema.prisma` for the authoritative fields, constraints, indexes, and cascading behavior.

## Background and scheduled work

Request handlers enqueue transactional messages in `OutboxMessage`; they do not wait for SMTP delivery. Every self-hosted Node.js instance starts a singleton one-minute worker that claims and sends a batch, retries failures, purges expired operational records, and updates a one-row `OperationalHeartbeat`. Queue row claims keep concurrent replicas safe. The protected `POST /api/internal/outbox` endpoint remains available as an external scheduler or recovery trigger.

## Storage

Asset metadata lives in PostgreSQL. Production file bytes live in a private S3-compatible bucket and are served through the application-controlled upload route. Local development can retain database blobs as a fallback. Production startup requires S3 configuration.

## Security headers and rendering

The proxy generates a fresh Content Security Policy nonce for application-page requests. The root layout waits for a real request so Next.js can attach the nonce to framework scripts. Other response headers include HSTS in production, frame denial, content-type protection, a restricted permissions policy, and a strict referrer policy.

This per-request nonce makes application pages dynamically rendered. Static metadata endpoints such as `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` remain static.

## Deployment shape

`next.config.ts` produces standalone output. The Docker image copies the standalone server, public assets, static chunks, and Prisma migrations into a non-root runtime image. PostgreSQL, Redis, S3, SMTP, TLS termination, scheduling, monitoring, and backup services are external production dependencies.
